  # in dist.ini

  [CheckMetaResources]

This is a "before release" L<Dist::Zilla> plugin that ensures that your META file
will contain some "resources" data.

sections, but 'homepage' is optional.

You can toggle any of these checks on or off.  For example:

  [CheckMetaResources]
  repository = 1
  bugtracker = 0
  homepage = 1
